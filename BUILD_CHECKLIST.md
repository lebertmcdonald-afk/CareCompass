# BUILD_CHECKLIST.md — Care Compass Platform

Day-by-day tasks with owners and verification steps.
Check off as you go. Both builders merge to main at each daily checkpoint.

---

## Day 1 — Scaffold & Data Foundation
**Goal:** Monorepo live, shared assets committed, each builder has a working data path before end of day.

### Both (morning — do together before splitting)
- [ ] Turborepo scaffold confirmed running — `npm run dev` starts both apps
- [ ] `packages/ui/MapEngine.types.ts` interface reviewed and locked — no changes after this point without sign-off
- [ ] Both builders can run `apps/compass` (port 5173) and `apps/console` (port 5174) locally
- [ ] Merge scaffold to `main`

### Lee — Door 1
- [ ] Source `us-counties-20m.geojson` from Census TIGER/Line and commit to `packages/utils/assets/`
- [ ] Source `county-adjacency.csv` from Census and commit to `packages/utils/assets/`
- [ ] Source `zip-county-crosswalk.csv` from scpike/uszips and commit to `packages/utils/assets/`
- [ ] Build `home_care_by_county.csv` by merging CMS Provider Data Catalog + Census ACS 2023 (Table S0101)
  - Filter CMS data to Provider Type = Home Health Agency
  - Group by county FIPS, count distinct agencies
  - Join with Census ACS senior population by county
  - Output columns: `county_fips, county_name, state_abbr, agency_count, senior_population, agencies_per_1k_seniors`
- [ ] Commit `home_care_by_county.csv` to `packages/utils/assets/`
- [ ] Verify ZIP codes 85145, 85139, 85128 resolve to desert counties in dataset
  - If they don't: identify real desert Maricopa County ZIPs and update demo scenario
- [ ] Static data path working: CSV parsing loads into `CountyFeature[]` without errors
- [ ] First county render: map displays with neutral fills (no panel logic yet)

**Day 1 verify (Lee):** `apps/compass` loads, map renders US counties in neutral fill, CSV data loads without error in console.

### Jillian — Door 2
- [ ] Supabase project created, connection string in `apps/console/.env.local`
- [ ] Schema live — all four core tables created and confirmed:
  - `public.coordinator_profiles`
  - `public.client_profiles` (includes `county_fips`, `pronouns`, `assigned_caregiver_id`)
  - `public.caregiver_profiles` (includes `county_fips`)
  - `public.assignments_log` (coordinator_id, client_id, caregiver_id, timestamp, match_score, note)
- [ ] Magic link auth working — coordinator can receive link and log in
- [ ] Clients List rendering — empty state visible with "Add New Client" CTA
- [ ] No fifth table created

**Day 1 verify (Jillian):** `apps/console` loads, magic link email received and works, Clients List renders empty state.

### Daily checkpoint
- [ ] Both builders merge feature branches to `main`
- [ ] MapEngine interface confirmed locked — no solo changes from this point
- [ ] DECISIONS.md O1 and O4 updated with resolution

---

## Day 2 — Panels, Profiles & Logic
**Goal:** Both doors have functional core flows. Dignity Profile completable. Family panel rendering real data.

### Lee — Door 1
- [ ] ZIP lookup flow: entry → `zipToCountyFips()` → county highlight → panel populate
- [ ] `ResourcePanel` live:
  - Desert status label
  - Agency count stat
  - Agencies per 1,000 seniors
  - Eldercare Locator link (always shown, "Start here" tag)
  - PACE finder link
  - State Medicaid link (routes to state-specific page using `state` code)
  - Medicare Advantage plan finder link
- [ ] Adjacency logic: `getNearestCountiesWithAgencies()` wired — nearest non-desert county surfaces when family county is desert
- [ ] "I need care here" stub: button present, ZIP flag recorded, confirmation text shown
- [ ] Error state: bad/unrecognized ZIP → inline error + direct Eldercare Locator link (no dead end)

**Day 2 verify (Lee):** Enter ZIP 85145 → county highlights → panel shows desert status → resource links visible → "I need care here" shows confirmation.

### Jillian — Door 2
- [ ] Dignity Profile form complete:
  - Client name (required)
  - Nickname, preferred language, gender preference for aide, one comfort, one key thing to avoid (all optional)
  - Emergency contacts NOT present
- [ ] Profile save, edit, view, and print working
- [ ] Success and error banners on save/edit
- [ ] Seed data script running:
  - 10–12 clients across 3–4 Maricopa County ZIPs, `county_fips` populated
  - 8–10 caregivers, same county spread
  - At least 1 Spanish-speaking caregiver
  - Most clients unassigned; 2–3 assigned (both states visible)
  - At least 1 county with 3+ unassigned clients
- [ ] Assignment advisory panel scaffolded: unassigned clients visible, match scores displaying

**Day 2 verify (Jillian):** Create a new Dignity Profile for a client → save → view → print. Seed data visible in Clients List.

### Daily checkpoint
- [ ] Both builders merge to `main`
- [ ] Full demo scenario walkable in rough form end-to-end (ZIP entry through family panel; coordinator profile create through assignment panel)

---

## Day 3 — Integration, Loop & Polish
**Goal:** Both doors connected through shared MapEngine. Demand loop demonstrable. Demo scenario runs clean.

### Lee — Door 1
- [ ] `MapEngine` fully wired in `apps/compass` — county fills driven by `computeFillValues()` output
- [ ] Choropleth fill colors match design tokens (desert = `--red-critical`, gap = `--orange-gap`, served = `--green-served`)
- [ ] Color legend always visible, includes text labels alongside swatches (WCAG 1.4.1)
- [ ] County hover tooltip working (Leaflet tooltip, not SVG text)
- [ ] Door 1 WCAG audit run against Figma Make output — any required corrections applied to `theme.css`
- [ ] DECISIONS.md O3 updated with audit result

**Day 3 verify (Lee):** Enter ZIP 85145 → desert county fills dark red → panel shows 0 agencies → legend visible → nearest county shows. Full visual matches Figma.

### Jillian — Door 2
- [ ] Real-time Supabase map live — county fills reflect unassigned client density from seed data
- [ ] Assignment flow complete:
  - Click county → assignment panel surfaces unassigned clients + caregiver matches
  - Each match shows score + why-line (interpretive, not tag restatement)
  - Filter chips working (language, distance, skill)
  - Assign button → confirmation modal with optional note field
  - Confirm → assignment logged to `assignments_log`
  - Map county fill updates to reflect assignment
  - Banner confirms successful assignment after modal closes
- [ ] Demand signal overlay live — Door 1 ZIP flags appear as county-level overlay on Door 2 map
- [ ] Door 2 WCAG check: legend always visible, `--text-on-surface-warm` used on `--surface-secondary`

**Day 3 verify (Jillian):** Full demo scenario end-to-end without intervention. Assignment logged to audit trail. Map updates after assignment.

### Integration (both)
- [ ] Full demo scenario walkthrough — family ZIP → desert → flag → coordinator map → assign → update
- [ ] QA pass: empty states, error states, edge cases, WCAG legend visibility on both doors
- [ ] Known-gap doc — anything not completed documented with status and demo workaround
- [ ] Known-gap doc committed to repo

### Daily checkpoint
- [ ] Demo scenario runs end-to-end without intervention
- [ ] Both doors pass WCAG 2.1 AA check
- [ ] Known-gap doc committed

## Day 4 — Final Polish & Demo Prep
**Goal:** Demo runs clean twice in a row. Both builders know their lines.

- [ ] Demo scenario rehearsed end-to-end — both builders
- [ ] Seed data reset script tested — can reset Supabase data to clean state before presentation
- [ ] Both apps confirmed running on presentation machine
- [ ] Browser windows arranged: Door 1 (port 5173) and Door 2 (port 5174) ready
- [ ] Known-gap doc reviewed — workarounds practiced for any incomplete items
- [ ] Final commit pushed to `main`
