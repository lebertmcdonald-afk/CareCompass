#Care Compass Care Platform A React monorepo containing two products built on a shared design system:

Care Console — internal coordinator tool for home health agency staff to manage client assignments and identify care deserts Care Compass — public-facing consumer tool for families to find Medicare-certified home health agencies near them

Both products share a token system, component library, and choropleth map implementation. See /docs for design system, decisions log, and builder handoff reference.

Getting Started

Install dependencies
npm install

Run Care Console (coordinator tool)
npm run dev:console

Run Care Compass (consumer tool)
npm run dev:compass

Run both concurrently
npm run dev

Products Care Console Audience: Home health agency coordinators (internal staff) URL: Internal — not publicly accessible Layout: Full-width three-zone desktop workspace — 220px sidebar / map canvas / 360px assignment panel Core workflow: Coordinator selects a county on the choropleth map → views unassigned clients and fit-ranked available aides → assigns aides to clients Care Compass Audience: Adult children and family members researching home care for an aging parent URL: Public-facing, no login required Layout: Centered single-column results page (max-width 780px) Core workflow: User enters ZIP code → sees agency count for their county → views nearest alternatives if zero → flags area as needing care

Shared Design System Both products use the same token system. Tokens are declared in packages/ui/tokens/tokens.css and imported by both apps. Key color tokens Token Hex Role --teal-primary #0F6E56 Search CTA, links (Compass only) --teal-deep #1D4E5A Nav active state (Console only) --teal-action #17383F All action buttons (Assign, Flag) --teal-light #E1F5EE Tag backgrounds, avatar fills, card surfaces --red-critical #C0392B Care desert stat, result card accent --green-served #27AE60 Assigned state, served map fill --orange-alert #B5450A Urgency badges only — never on buttons --text-muted #767676 Minimum text color on white — WCAG AA floor --canvas #F8F7F4 Page background --surface #FFFFFF Card / panel background

Full token reference: docs/design-system.md Typography Inter throughout. Scale: 32px display / 24px hero / 16px heading / 14px body / 12px caption. No other typefaces in scope. WCAG 2.1 AA Both products are required to meet WCAG 2.1 AA. #9A9A9A fails on white and is restricted to decorative elements only. #767676 is the minimum for any text. See docs/DECISIONS.md — 002 for rationale.

Map Component The choropleth map is a shared component in packages/ui/map/. It is used by both products with different configurations. ⚠️ Critical implementation notes County label technique: Labels use SVG paint-order halo, not white rect badges. See docs/DECISIONS.md — 005.

<text

fill="#1A1A1A"

stroke="#FFFFFF"

stroke-width="3"

paint-order="stroke fill"

County Name

County geometry: Real SVG path data or Mapbox/Leaflet embed required. The Figma mock uses a rectangle grid placeholder — do not replicate this in code. Source geometry from US Census TIGER/Line shapefiles (simplified with Mapshaper). GeoJSON stored in /public/geo/. See docs/DECISIONS.md — 006. Map configuration by product Config Care Console Care Compass Pins Yes — caregiver locations No Selected county highlight Yes — thick dark border No Hover tooltip County + unassigned count County + agency count Legend items 6 (including Care desert county) 3 (No agencies / Some / Well served) Position in layout Center zone (always visible) Bottom of page (optional context)

Docs File Contents Audience docs/design-system.md Token tables, color roles, typography, spacing, button tiers, screen constraints PRD / stakeholders docs/DECISIONS.md Non-obvious design and build decisions with rationale and rejected alternatives Developers, future contributors docs/builder-handoff.md Full CSS specs, component code, accessibility checklist, open items Build reference — retire after initial build

Open Items Four known gaps between the Figma mocks and build requirements. See docs/DECISIONS.md — Open Items for detail.

Contributing When making a non-obvious design or build decision, add an entry to docs/DECISIONS.md before opening a PR. Format: decision → rationale → what was considered and rejected.

Do not introduce new color values without updating packages/ui/tokens/tokens.css and docs/design-system.md. No hardcoded hex values in component files.
